# Benchmarks

This project aims for roughly O(n^2) behavior given:
- bounded-radius detection of configurations,
- O(n) reductions,
- constant-size lifting patches.

In this reference implementation:
- configuration detection is O(n) by scanning darts/edges,
- lifting uses constant-size subset enumeration,
- optional 3-connectivity checking is O(n^3) and should be disabled for performance.

## Run quick timing

```bash
python - <<'PY'
import time
import barnette_proof as bp

for n in [8,16,24,32]:
    G = bp.make_prism(max(4, n//2))
    t0=time.time()
    C = bp.find_hamiltonian_cycle(G, check_3conn_each_step=False, debug=False)
    t1=time.time()
    print("n=",len(G.adj),"time=",t1-t0)
